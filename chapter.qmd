## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with an introduction to the free statistical software R along with RStudio and the tidyverse packages. While R can have a steep learning curve and be intimidating to new users, especially those new to coding, RStudio and the tidyverse packages make R much more accessible. Beyond improving accessibility, these tools are intentionally designed to make users more productive with R and improve the reproducibility of their work. Not surprisingly, this chapter is focused on the "how to" of foundational data work


RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) specifically designed to help users be more efficient and effective with R (and Python). The tidyverse, as described on its is a popular collection of packages or libraries that all share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. [@Tidyverse-2024-08-15]
