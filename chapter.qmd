## Introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with an introduction to the free statistical software R along with RStudio and the tidyverse packages. While R can have a steep learning curve and be intimidating to new users, especially those new to coding, RStudio and the tidyverse packages make R much more accessible. Beyond improving accessibility, these tools are intentionally designed to make users more productive with R and improve the reproducibility of their work. Not surprisingly, this chapter is focused on the "how to" of foundational data work. We will highlight and demonstrate essential best practices for using R with RStudio and the tidyverse for quantitative research. However, don't let this chapter's focus on first steps of data work deceive, R and its ecosystem of extension packages allow for the implementation of all the statistical techniques found in this book and much, much more.

## R

R is a powerful and highly flexible statistical analysis tool. It provides a wide array of statistical techniques and methods while also providing highly developed graphics capabilities. R's ability to create publication-quality graphics has been, and continues to be, one of its greatest strengths. It does all of this free of charge with a dedicated community of developers.

The R project is a GNU project, which means it is a free software, mass collaboration project. Knowing that R is open source and is actively developed and maintained through mass collaboration provides important context for users concerning its basic structure and potential resources. R can be considered as being made up of two 2 parts:

1.  the base R system that is downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, also known as CRAN, and
2.  a large ecosystem of extension packages, sometimes called libraries.

The base R system is actively maintained and updated for various operating systems by the R Core Team. Typically there is 1 major update along with 2 minor updates per year. Having an active release schedule like this is critical for the success of open source software. This ensures up-to-date compatibility with operating systems and signals to users that it won't be abandoned.

While the base R system adequately covers most statistical needs and functionality, it is arguably the large ecosystem of extension packages that has contributed to R's growth. Packages can provide implementations of methodologies not currently in base R, improve the usability of R, or provide tools that allow you to do non-statistical tasks (i.e. sending emails or building websites). In particular, the tidyverse packages have been very influential and have made working with R significantly more accessible. We will take a closer look at the tidyverse packages later in this chapter.

As of this writing, the CRAN package repository features over 21,000 contributed packages. The CRAN repository checks all packages for compatibility and expects the packages to be maintained, which means users can expect packages from the CRAN repository to work with R. This work is done by a network of volunteers, called the CRAN team, and it is a testament to the size and dedication of the R community that this is possible. Though CRAN is the primary R package repository, users can find packages through:

-   CRAN-like repositories such as BioConductor and R-forge;
-   GitHub and BitBucket;
-   Personal websites.

While packages outside of the CRAN repository aren't vetted by the CRAN team for compatibility, they can be very useful. They may implement cutting edge statistical techniques or provide tools for more bespoke analyses. Going through the CRAN submission process can be daunting, time intensive, and restrictive so it is not uncommon to find very useful packages not hosted on CRAN.

### Using R

A common roadblock for many new R users is that it requires the users to write code or commands. This can be a significant hurdle for many, but there are several free software options that make working with R much more user-friendly. The most popular being RStudio, which we will discuss in more detail later on in the chapter. The need to write code or commands isn't removed, but it is made much more intuitive and accessing help is made easier. Using R and having to write code is a net positive for increasing the reproducibility of research, at least for computational and analysis work.

The value of learning to write R code is significantly enhanced by following best practices for coding and setting up workflows. When users are first learning it can seem unnecessary to follow such advice, but it is important to avoid developing bad and inefficient habits. RStudio and the tidyverse are specifically designed to guide users to follow and implement best practices. We will be highlighting and demonstrating some of these best practices in the following sections, but readers wanting more guidance should see the **Suggested further readings**.

## RStudio

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed to make working with R more accessible and productive. While R comes with its own graphical user interface (GUI), it simply was not designed with a wide range of users in mind. So, it is common that R be paired with some other open source software such as RStudio, R Commander, Deducer, jupyter notebooks, vscode, or positron. RStudio is by far the most widely used and known. A significant portion of R's growth in usage can be reasonably attributed to RStudio. It has become synonymous with R. RStudio can be downloaded for free from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/. 

When RStudio is first opened, there are 4 panes as seen in @fig-rstudio-layout. Sometimes the source pane is missing, but that is easily remedied by opening a new R script (.R file): **File > New File > R Script**.

1. The **Source pane** is where you can edit and save R scripts, which are essentially text files containing R code. This is where most of the data analysis work happens and should be documented.  

1. The **Console pane** is used to write short interactive R commands. 

1. The **Environment pane** displays temporary R objects as created during that R session. It also contains the useful history tab.

1. The **Output pane** displays the plots, tables, or HTML outputs of executed code along with saved files. This pane also includes the packages and help tabs which are especially useful since the first is for managing and installing packages and the second is setup to help access documentation.

Before we even start working with data there are 2 essential best practices that should be discussed:

1. Adjustment of a few RStudio default options to improve long-term reproducibility of the data analysis work. 

1. Improve organization and collaboration (this includes with your future self) by always using RStudio projects. 

When you quit R, do not save the workspace to an .Rdata file. When you launch, do not reload the workspace from an .Rdata file. Long-term reproducibility is enhanced when you turn this feature off and clear R's memory at every restart. Starting with a blank slate provides timely feedback that encourages the development of scripts that are complete and self-contained.
The changing these options ensures development of R scripts that are complete and self-contained records of the data work. 

In RStudio, set this via **Tools > Global Options**, uncheck "Restore .RData into Workspace at Startup" and choose **Never** on the "Save workspace to .RData on exit". See @fig-rstudio-wrk-options.

![RStudio's Globol Options: Workspace Best Practice](image/rstudio-workspace-options.png){#fig-rstudio-wrk-options fig-alt="Adjusting RStudio's global options for workspaces to not restore at startup and never save on exit." fig-align="center"}

### Work in projects

RStudio projects make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

To create a new project in the RStudio, use the File > New Project command.

In the New Project wizard that pops up, select New Directory, then New Project. Name the project “hello-ggplot2” and then click the Create Project button.

This will launch you into a new RStudio Project inside a new folder called “hello-ggplot2”.

RStudio projects give you a solid workflow that will serve you well in the future:

- Create an RStudio project for each data analysis project.

- Keep data files there; we’ll talk about loading them into R in Local Data.

- Keep scripts there; edit them, run them in bits or as a whole.

- Save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there.

Everything you need is in one place, and cleanly separated from all the other projects that you are working on.

RStudio is maintained by Posit PBC (Public Benefit Corporation), previously named RStudio. Posit is a leading company in the R ecosystem, not only because of RStudio, but because of their investments in open source software (e.g. tidyverse, tidymodels, quarto, shiny, etc) and education/training. They supply free content to help 

Loading packages lead into tidyverse 

## Tidyverse

> The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. [@Tidyverse-2024-08-15]

Everything that we can do with tidyverse tools can be done with base R tools.

Overview of core packages and adjacent packages

The core tidyverse includes the packages that you're likely to use in everyday data analyses. As of tidyverse 2.0, the following packages are included in the core tidyverse:

- `ggplot2` is a system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics. You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.

- `dplyr` provides a grammar of data manipulation, providing a consistent set of verbs that solve the most common data manipulation challenges. 

- `tidyr` provides a set of functions that help you get to tidy data. Tidy data is data with a consistent form: in brief, every variable goes in a column, and every column is a variable.

- readr provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data (like csv, tsv, and fwf).

- purrr enhances R’s functional programming toolkit by providing a complete and consistent set of tools for working with functions and vectors.

- tibble is a modern re-imagining of the data frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what it has not. 

- `stringr` provides a cohesive set of functions designed to make working with strings as easy as possible.

- `forcats` provides a suite of useful tools that solve common problems with factors. 

- `lubridate` provides a set of tools to make it easier to work with dates and times in R, which can be difficult and inconsistent in base R.
